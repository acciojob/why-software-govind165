<h1>Why I want to become a developer</h1>
	<p> I want to become a software developer because I enjoy solving problems and building tools that can help people in their everyday lives. 
        Technology is constantly evolving, and being a developer allows me to keep learning new things while creating innovative solutions. 
        The creativity, challenge, and opportunity to make a real impact in the world through code motivate me every day to improve my skills 
        and grow in this field.</p>
